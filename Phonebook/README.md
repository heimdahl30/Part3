Please not this repository has two branches which have different contents for the index.js file. The main branch has the index.js file which saves newly added data to the Atlas Mongo DB and doesn't have code to avoid duplication as question 3.14 said it can be skipped.

Without_db_code branch has index.js file which contains code without the part which includes db code amongst other things.
